# Mad Chatter for Mac!

This is a MacRuby wrapper for a Mad Chatter chatroom. It's really just a web browser with Growl support.

Open it up in XCode and change the URL of the website that it opens (default is `http://localhost:3000`).

Feel free to fork and contribute changes you think would be helpful for others.
